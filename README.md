# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
Users can play against each other by clicking on the grid to place 'X' or 'O'.  
The game detects wins, disables completed cells, and allows resetting the game.

## Features

- Two-player turn-based gameplay (no AI).  
- Automatic win detection with predefined winning patterns.  
- Disables used boxes to prevent overwriting moves.  
- Reset button to restart the game anytime.  
- Displays the winner message on game completion.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.  
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game board and controls.  
- **CSS3**: Styling for the grid, buttons, and messages.

## How It Works

- The game board consists of 9 clickable boxes.  
- Players alternate turns placing 'X' or 'O' in empty boxes.  
- After each move, the game checks if a winning pattern is met.  
- When a player wins, the remaining boxes are disabled, and a message is shown.  
- The reset button clears the board and restarts the game.
